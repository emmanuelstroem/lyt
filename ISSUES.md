## Current Issues

### Issue #43: Mini Player Always Shows P1 Instead of Currently Playing Channel (RESOLVED ✅)
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Platform**: All platforms  
**Description**: Fixed mini player to show the correct currently playing channel instead of always showing P1.

**Root Cause**:
- Mini player was falling back to `serviceManager.selectedChannel` (P1) when `playingChannel` was nil
- Visibility condition was too broad, showing mini player even when no channel was actually playing
- Play/pause button was calling `togglePlayback()` without specifying which channel to toggle

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ **Correct Visibility Logic**: Changed from `serviceManager.audioPlayer.isPlaying || serviceManager.playingChannel != nil` to `if let playingChannel = serviceManager.playingChannel`
  - Mini player now only shows when there's actually a channel playing
  - No longer shows when just a channel is selected but not playing
- ✅ **Direct Channel Reference**: Removed `currentChannel` computed property and use `playingChannel` directly
  - Eliminates fallback to `selectedChannel` which was causing P1 to always show
  - All UI elements now reference the actual playing channel
- ✅ **Correct Playback Control**: Play/pause button now calls `serviceManager.togglePlayback(for: playingChannel)`
  - Ensures the correct channel is toggled, not the selected channel
  - Works with any channel that's actually playing

**Files Modified**:
- `lyt/Views/Components/MiniPlayer.swift`: Fixed channel selection and visibility logic

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Visibility**: `if let playingChannel = serviceManager.playingChannel` - only show when channel is playing
- **Channel Reference**: Direct use of `playingChannel` instead of computed property with fallback
- **Playback Control**: `serviceManager.togglePlayback(for: playingChannel)` for correct channel control
- **UI Elements**: All channel info, colors, and artwork now use the actual playing channel

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Correct Channel Display**: Mini player now shows the actual channel that's playing
- **Proper Channel Switching**: Selecting play on any channel now works correctly
- **Accurate State**: Mini player only appears when there's actual audio playback
- **Consistent Behavior**: Play/pause button controls the correct channel

**Result**: ✅ Mini player now shows the correct playing channel and responds to channel selection

### Issue #42: Mini Player Immediate Updates and Automatic Refresh (RESOLVED ✅)
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Platform**: All platforms  
**Description**: Fixed play/pause button immediate visual feedback and added automatic content refresh for channel and show details.

**Root Cause**:
- Play/pause button was only updating when external areas were tapped due to state synchronization delays
- Channel and show details were not updating automatically, requiring manual refresh
- No automatic polling for live program updates

**Changes Applied**:
- ✅ **Immediate Button State**: Added local `@State` for immediate visual feedback
  - Button updates instantly when clicked using `isPlayingState.toggle()`
  - Syncs with actual audio state via `onChange(of: serviceManager.audioPlayer.isPlaying)`
- ✅ **Automatic Content Refresh**: Added 5-second timer for live updates
  - Uses `Timer.publish(every: 5.0)` to refresh content automatically
  - Calls `serviceManager.refreshNowPlaying()` every 5 seconds
  - Updates channel names, show titles, and program details automatically
- ✅ **State Synchronization**: Proper state management between local and global state
  - Local state for immediate UI feedback
  - Global state for actual audio playback status
  - Automatic synchronization between both states

**Files Modified**:
- `lyt/Views/Components/MiniPlayer.swift`: Added immediate updates and automatic refresh

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Local State**: `@State private var isPlayingState = false` for immediate button updates
- **State Sync**: `onChange(of: serviceManager.audioPlayer.isPlaying)` to keep states in sync
- **Auto Refresh**: `onReceive(Timer.publish(every: 5.0))` for automatic content updates
- **Combine Import**: Added `import Combine` for timer functionality

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Instant Feedback**: Play/pause button responds immediately when clicked
- **Live Updates**: Channel and show information updates automatically every 5 seconds
- **Real-time Progress**: Progress bar updates with current show progress
- **Seamless Experience**: No need to tap outside mini player to see updates

**Result**: ✅ Play/pause button updates immediately, content refreshes automatically
