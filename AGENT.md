## App Name
Lyt ‚Äî A Professional Client for DR (Danmerks Radio) Audio Streams

## Description
This app is a cross-platform (iOS/macOS/iPadOS/tvOS) audio player for listening to live and scheduled programming from Danmarks Radio (DR), using public data from [https://www.dr.dk/lyd](https://www.dr.dk/lyd).

The app uses JSON endpoints found via the DR Lyd website to display current programming (`now`), fetch metadata, and stream audio (typically HLS `.m3u8` streams). Playback is handled via AVFoundation.

This is a multiplatform app. The same code should be compatible with iOS, macOS, tvOS and iPadOS.

I am using Xcode-beta to build the code because my system is running on MacOS Tahoe beta. 

Agent must NOT make changes to `*.xcodeproj` files. Instead, let me know what changes to make. Since these changes easily break the build. 
Agent must NOT make changes to this file. Instead, use the README.md or create an ISSUES.md, etc

Note:

- There are different color specifications for iOS, macOS and tvOS. Here is the comprehensive list: https://mar.codes/apple-colors

## Agent Role

The agent may assist with:
- Fetching and parsing DR audio program metadata (live and scheduled)
- Managing media playback via AVPlayer
- Mapping UI elements to DR channels or program data
- Performing periodic updates (e.g., polling for new programs)
- Helping with error handling, fallbacks, and graceful UX
- Ensuring compliance with public data use policies
- Ensure there are no memory issues withe application
- Efficiently handle audio playback, handoff to airplay or bluetooth, and graceful handover to other applications like phone, music, spotify, alarm, etc
- Handle gracefully termination when the application is quite 
- Ability to resume playback when Audio interface is freed up again 
- Optional: Generating audio program summaries or recommendations

## Main Endpoints (Discovered)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Subject to change; verify endpoint structure via network inspector

- `https://api.dr.dk/radio/v4/schedules/all/now`  
  Provides live information about what's currently playing (title, channel, start time, stream URL).
  
- Example stream (P3):  
  `https://live-radio.dr.dk/p3/live.m3u8`

- Program guide (optional):  
  `https://www.dr.dk/api/radio/programs/{channelId}`

- Show metadata (optional):  
  `https://www.dr.dk/api/radio/shows/{showId}`

---

## Playback Constraints

- Use HLS (.m3u8) URLs only with `AVPlayer`
- Do not transcode or redistribute streams
- Use background audio capabilities on mobile platforms
- Display current program metadata accurately and in sync

---

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Show current station (e.g., P1, P3) and program name
- Allow easy channel switching
- Show album cover photos of shows 
- Show host(s) and description of the shows and any time/duration related 
- Optional: Program schedule viewer
- Optional: Favorite or "bookmark" features for programs

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Respect DR‚Äôs terms of use (no caching or redistribution without permission)
- Do not modify or alter content metadata
- Attribution to DR should be present if data is shown directly from DR endpoints

---

## Agent Tools

The agent may have access to:
- `fetchJSON(url)`: Downloads and parses a JSON endpoint
- `parseNowPlaying(json)`: Extracts currently playing title, description, stream URL
- `playStream(url)`: Uses `AVPlayer` to start or stop playback
- `updateUI(nowPlaying)`: Refreshes UI labels and images
- `handleError(error)`: Logs or displays audio/network issues

---

## Environment & Platforms

- **Language**: Swift (using SwiftUI for interface developement)
- **Platforms**: iOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS (via SwiftUI universal codebase)
- **Audio**: with background playback where supported

---

## Goals for Agents

- Maintain accurate, real-time playback with minimal latency
- Keep metadata in sync with current stream
- Offer reliable, accessible audio streaming experience
- Handle error states and stream changes gracefully
- Avoid unnecessary battery/network usage
- Do NOT make changes to `*.xcodeproj`

---

## Non-Goals

- No offline downloads or caching
- No editing or remapping of stream content
- No access to private DR APIs or non-public data

---

## Phases

### Phase 0: Prototyping

- Hit the API endpoint and use the response structure in now.json to construct some dummy data for local testing.
- Build the data model for the API and validate that the response fits model structure

### Phase 1: Local Testing
- Assume that the web requests are working
- Build the user interface for loading the data 
- Test validate that the test data can load on it

### Phase 2: URL testing
- Check network connection 
- Ensure that the web requests succeeed
- Fetch the program schedule, build urls and metadata from the API
- Use this data to populate the interface. 

---

## Builds 

- Code MUST build successfully
- Swift compilation MUST also succeed and 
- Executables MUST be created


### iOS ‚úÖ VALIDATED
```bash
# Debug (for development)
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build

# Release (recommended - cleaner, no debug artifacts)
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -configuration Release build
```

### macOS ‚úÖ VALIDATED  
```bash
# Debug (may have dyld Team ID issues)
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=macOS' build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"

# Release (recommended - avoids Team ID mismatch)
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Release build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"
```

### Additional Platforms (Should work but not tested)
For iPadOS and tvOS, use these variations:
```bash
# iPadOS Release
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Air 11-inch (M3)' -configuration Release build

# tvOS Release
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV' -configuration Release build
```

**üí° Recommendation**: Use **Release builds** for testing and running the app to avoid code signing and dynamic library issues that occur in Debug builds.

### Troubleshooting: Xcode Launch Error (SOLVED ‚úÖ)

**Issue**: `Could not launch "lyt" - bundle doesn't contain an executable` 

**Root Cause**: Swift compilation errors due to macOS/iOS color compatibility issues prevented the executable from being created, even though the build appeared to "succeed."

**Solution**: Use platform-specific colors in SwiftUI:
```swift
// Platform-specific background colors
private var backgroundColor: Color {
    #if os(macOS)
    Color(NSColor.controlBackgroundColor)
    #else
    Color(.systemBackground)
    #endif
}
```

**Key Learning**: When the app bundle exists but has no executable, check for Swift compilation errors by looking for actual compile output, not just the final "BUILD SUCCEEDED" message.

### Troubleshooting: dyld Team ID Mismatch Error (SOLVED ‚úÖ)

**Issue**: `no such file, not in dyld cache` and `mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different Team IDs`

**Root Cause**: Debug builds create a `lyt.debug.dylib` with different Team ID than the main executable:
- Main executable: `TeamIdentifier=A9Q5VPE9WX` (Apple Developer signing)  
- Debug dylib: `TeamIdentifier=not set` (adhoc signing)

**Solution**: Build in Release mode to avoid debug dylibs:
```bash
# For macOS (avoids debug dylib entirely)
xcodebuild -project lyt.xcodeproj -scheme lyt -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Release build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"
```

**Alternative Solution**: Use `DRServiceFactory.createService(.mock)` in Debug builds to avoid network-related debug symbols.

**Key Learning**: Release builds are cleaner and avoid many development-time signing/debugging artifacts that can cause runtime issues.

### Platform-Specific Color System ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation**: Comprehensive platform-specific color system based on [Apple Colors guide](https://mar.codes/apple-colors)

**Features**:
- **iOS**: Uses full iOS system color palette (`systemBackground`, `systemGray6`, `label`, etc.)
- **macOS**: Uses macOS-specific colors (`controlBackgroundColor`, `controlColor`, `labelColor`, etc.) 
- **tvOS**: Uses tvOS-appropriate colors with fallbacks (`systemGray`, black/white basics)

**Key Color Mappings**:
```swift
// Background colors properly mapped per platform
private var backgroundColor: Color {
    #if os(macOS)
    Color(NSColor.controlBackgroundColor)
    #elseif os(tvOS)
    Color.black // tvOS dark theme
    #else // iOS
    Color(.systemBackground)
    #endif
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ No more color compatibility errors across platforms
- ‚úÖ Native look and feel on each platform
- ‚úÖ Proper dark mode support per platform conventions
- ‚úÖ Accessibility compliance per platform guidelines
